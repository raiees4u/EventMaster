Steps to Prepare Your GitHub Repository

    Create a Repository:
        Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
        Name it appropriately, e.g., EventMaster-WebApp.
        Add a description: "Final Web Application Project for EventMaster - Event Management System."

    Organize Repository Structure: Ensure your project structure is clean and understandable. Here’s an example structure:

EventMaster-WebApp/
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── db.js
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── userRoutes.js
│   │   ├── eventRoutes.js
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── User.js
│   │   ├── Event.js
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── index.js
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── screenshots/
    ├── dashboard.png
    ├── login.png

Add a README File: Your README.md should explain the project clearly:

    Project Title: EventMaster Web Application
    Description: A full-stack web application for event management.
    Features: Authentication, event CRUD operations, responsive design.
    Technologies Used: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
    Setup Instructions:

    # Backend
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm start

    # Frontend
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start

    Contributors: Include all team members.

Show Commit Contributions:

    Ensure each member commits code to the repository (e.g., backend routes, frontend components).
    Use meaningful commit messages like:
        Added login API in userRoutes
        Implemented event dashboard UI
        Connected MongoDB to backend

Include Screenshots: Add a screenshots folder with images of the application (e.g., login page, dashboard). Reference them in your README for visual clarity.

Push Your Work to GitHub:

    Add all files:

        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit for EventMaster project"
        git push origin main

        Ensure commits are from all team members by collaborating via branches or local repositories.

    Share the Repository Link: Provide the GitHub repository link in your presentation (e.g., https://github.com/YourTeam/EventMaster-WebApp).

Showcasing Your Repository During the Presentation

    Navigate the Repository:
        Show the README.md file and explain the structure.
        Highlight the commit history and point out contributions from each member.
        Explain the organization of frontend/ and backend/ folders.

    Point Out Features:
        Discuss specific files, such as server.js, API routes, and frontend components.
        Mention how each file contributes to the functionality of the project.

    Acknowledge Issues:
        Be transparent about challenges (e.g., database connection issues) and how you plan to fix them.

Tips for Demonstrating Your GitHub Repository

    Practice navigating your repository before presenting.
    Focus on key areas: README.md, commit history, and significant code files.
    Mention how the repository reflects your teamwork and organization.
